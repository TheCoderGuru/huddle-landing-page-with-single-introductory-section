## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learn the concept of css grids and the properties involved to customize a grid which in this instance is the ```grid-template-columns``` property and requires two arguments, number of columns and the amount of space between each column.
This particular is quite powerful since once you specify the number of columns automatically the number of rows will be generated since a grid is made up of both rows and columns.

### Continued development

I plan to research more on css grids and practicing using grids to create seemingly simple designs and once I am comfortable proceed to more complex designs using the various properties that are comprised of css grid.
